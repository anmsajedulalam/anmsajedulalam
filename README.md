    <b>Greetings, this is Sajid! :bowtie: </b>
</p>

I'm a curious dumb guy who has a desire for tech and research. Trying to learn something each day. I love to code and build things. My current focus is to work with AI/ML/DL. At present actively looking for opportunities to collaborate in research and development related to data science.
        
Tbh, I'm not a theoretical person, I'm more of an implementation person. But I like to dig into loopholes by studying research papers, blogs & articles, or YouTube videos to learn more & develop them. Rn, I'm highly interested in deep learning technologies. Computer vision stuffs really fascinates me. Additionally, I'd like to work with sustainable development such as sustainable accommodation, agricultural technologies, organic food & nutrition. I want to work in research & building something which people can use at a low price but can make their life easy. There's a lot to do better things with my skills rather than just keep working to build something which people can't even afford.

I'm fond of problem-solving from school & was intensely involved in math club at my school. Participated in many math contests & math Olympiads during my school period because I was totally enjoying solving advanced math problems & wished to attend any international math contest or Olympiad such as IMO or APMO someday badly. I'd taken preparation for those contests in my high school. Luckily, I got some mentors as well who were ex-contestants of these Olympiads. I'd this opportunity to learn problem-solving strategies from them. I participated multiple times in the regional Mathematical Olympiad from 2007 to 2011. I also liked solving Rubik's cube. I solved mirror cube, cylinder cube, pyramid cube & 2×2, 3×3 cubes. Always wanted to participate in Rubik's cube competitions. From 6th grade to 10th grade my interest was to be a mathematician someday or an astronomer. I also tried to explore astronomy out of curiosity. I'm still very fond of space & I think till I die it will not change. I started learning to program in 11th grade. The first learned programming language was visual basic. Participated in school-level programming contests such as the regional Olympiad for Informatics in 2012. I really liked the concepts of software & hardware after getting a computer in 11th grade. I eventually decided to be a programmer someday. Nowadays, I'm trying my best to solve real-life industry problems through my problem-solving & programming skills. The more complicated problem, the more it's fun to solve. AI attracts me a lot recently.

The smell of coffee & rain makes my life better. It's a good combination I believe if I can have coffee while it's been raining. I've lovebirds who give me peaceful moments.

I make coffee because it makes me feel better. The smell of the coffee makes me refilled to start from the beginning of my mind. </p>
